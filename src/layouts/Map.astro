          Welcome to my interactive hiking map! I've carefully crafted this
          resource to help you explore the {map.name} just as I experienced it during
          my filming. The colored lines represent different route options: the main
          trail, alternate routes, and/or optional side trips. I've also marked key
          points of interest with custom icons - from breathtaking viewpoints to
          hidden gems and cultural landmarks that made this adventure truly special.

          Feel free to zoom, pan, and click on any marker to learn more about
          that specific location. Each point includes my personal observations
          and practical tips that didn't make it into my video but could enhance
          your own journey.

          While this interactive map is great for planning your {map.name},
          having offline access during your hike is essential for safety and
          navigation. I've created a downloadable GPS file (available below)
          that's compatible with popular hiking apps like Maps.me, Gaia GPS, and
          Google Earth. Simply download the file and import it into your
          preferred app before hitting the trail.

        <Text variant="body">
          <b>Pro tip:</b> I recommend downloading both the map and the surrounding
          area in your chosen app while you still have internet access. This ensures
          you'll have detailed topographic data even in areas with no cell service.

          I hope this interactive map helps you visualize and plan your own
          adventure on the {map.name}. Remember that conditions can change, and
          while I strive to provide accurate information, always check current
          conditions, bring appropriate gear, and follow local guidelines and
          Leave No Trace principles.
