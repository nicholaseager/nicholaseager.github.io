This is extremely physically demanding, so you need a good understanding of your physical ability before attempting (check out my video above \ud83d\ude42) However, you do have the option to spend the night at the bottom of the canyon which could make the journey easier and provide an excellent sunrise from the bottom.",

We stayed at Mather Campground, which I can recommend because it is cheap and easy to access the rim. Each campsite has a picnic table, fire ring, and bear box. The campground has flush toilets, as well as a few coin-operated showers. There are water spigots located within the campground. It is also located within walking distance of Grand Canyon Village, where you will find a variety of amenities, such as a general store, restaurants, and a post office. It's a great base for starting your hike from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.",

Only specific campsites along the river are available for backcountry camping, which calls for a permit. Phantom Ranch provides meals, dormitory-style lodging, and rustic cabins; however, reservations must be made well in advance due to high demand. Tent camping is available at Bright Angel Campground along with access to restrooms, running water, and a ranger station. Both camping and Phantom Ranch are interesting options with breathtaking views, but Phantom Ranch may be preferred by those looking for more conveniences and amenities. No matter what, all overnight visitors need to be ready for the harsh surroundings and low temperatures.",

Begin with sturdy and comfortable hiking boots, providing ample ankle support for the rugged terrain. Opt for moisture-wicking clothing to manage perspiration, and layer accordingly to accommodate temperature fluctuations within the canyon. A well-fitted backpack should carry essentials such as a refillable water reservoir, high-energy snacks, a first aid kit, a trail map, and a lightweight but durable rain jacket. Sun protection, including a wide-brimmed hat and sunscreen, is paramount due to the canyon's exposure to intense sunlight. Trekking poles offer stability on uneven paths and reduce the impact on joints during the descent.",
