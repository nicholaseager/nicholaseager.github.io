In addition to being a trekking guide, B\u00e1o and his family grow rice and corn in terraces, and cardamom in the jungle. The Dao is an ethnic minority group in Vietnam, known for their colorful traditional clothing and rich cultural traditions. Dao women are known for their brightly colored embroidered clothing, which is often worn on special occasions. The clothing is usually made of indigo-dyed cloth and features intricate patterns and designs. Dao men may also wear traditional clothing, such as loose-fitting pants and a long tunic.",

Everyone got to know each other around the fire through Vietnamese, Dao, and a little English. We were so tired that we went to bed at 19:30.",
