  "description": "When I did this hike, we started from Bright Angel Trailhead, hiked down to Plateau Point, further down to Phantom Ranch, and then back up to South Kaibab Trailhead. We completed the entire route (over 26 miles) in one day. This is extremely physically demanding, so you need a good understanding of your physical ability before attempting (check out my video above \ud83d\ude42) However, you do have the option to spend the night at the bottom of the canyon which could make the journey easier and provide an excellent sunrise from the bottom.",
